        <p>Salmon Cookies is a small family owned business operating in multiple locations around Seattle, WA. Pat Smith comes from a long line of Dentists and Meg Smith was a dairy farmer.  They met in 2002 and fell in love instantly. They and their two kids Jane and Joe wanted to spend more family time together and baking was one of thier favorite activities. They decided to open a bakery and wanted to sell a product that showed off their wholesome PNW spirt and so the Salmon Cookie was born.</p>
